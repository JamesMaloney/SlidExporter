# SlidExporter
A simple Python script to recover slides in pdf format from a nice guy who prefers YouTube videos to PowerPoint presentations

Requires opencv-python (pip install opencv-python), and can be also used to convert videos to images frame by frame, should you ever need to do such a horrible thing
